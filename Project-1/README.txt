#Project 1 Problem Statement:
- Bulding a model that would predict Happy vs UnHappy customers with a minimum accuracy of 77%. In addition, feature extraction
was done to obtain top predictores of output Y
- Several algorithms were tested for the sake of exploring different outcomes and running multiple techniques including KNN, LR, Decision
Tree and RandomForests along with one to multiple Hyperparameter Optimization using GridSearch techniques 
- KNN algorithm proves to be the best out of all algorithms to give results with an accuracy of 77%. SelectbestK with F_ClassF feature
extraction techniques was used to grab top 4 contributing features (questions) in predicting Happy vs UnHappy customers.
